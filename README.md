# DiplomacyGameLSTM

## Instructions


To run the project:

* Download the whole folder in order to run the different notebooks on your local machine.

* Additionally, download all samples of the dataset from https://github.com/DenisPeskov/2020_acl_diplomacy/tree/master/data

Make sure to adjust the file paths to the csv files, which could potentially provide issues (pd.read_csv("")).

Happy Coding!
